## Technologies

Project is created with:

- JavaScript ES6
- HTMl 5
- CSS 2.1

## Features

The Weather-app is designed to:

- search for weather by city name and user's geolocation
- display current, hourly and daily weather data
- change colors depending on day time at the specified location

## Launch

The easiest way to launch this project is through the [link](https://barbara-musial.github.io/Weather-app/ "Weather-app").
If it does not work, then I would recommend to do it through VSC and Live Server extension.

### Instruction

1. Download this repository and unpack to your desired location.

2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download "VSC download link").
3. Open VSC and on the left side bar choose "Extenstions" and search for "Live Stream". It should look something like that:

4. You should reopen Visual Studio Code now.
5. In a top left corner choose: File -> Open Folder -> Choose folder where repository was unpacked.
6. On a bottom right corner you should see a button "Go Live":

   Click it.

7. Project should now be opened in your browser.

If you are using Internet Explorer it might not work, because the project is build using modules, which are not supported by this browser. I would highly suggest using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.pl/chrome/?brand=FKPE&gclid=CjwKCAjw9LSSBhBsEiwAKtf0n8HlQ0uNvyvBCIg2qgYBDoBYR6ACajO4wJ4J5MIGDrU6k5CQoSrw-BoCN5oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) instead.

It will not work by opening only index.html for the same reason.
